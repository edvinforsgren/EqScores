## Code for the manuscript: A scalable, data analytics workflow for image-based morphological profiles
Note 1. To run the code, you need to install pyPLS (https://github.com/ocloarec/pyPLS)

Note 2. The data calculated from "1. Benchmark Create Eq. scores.ipynb" and "2. Benchmark calc_knn_prec_recall.ipynb" is already available in "./data". Therefore, it is possible to start at 3.
